# Open-Street-Map-Project

Import XML OSM file from Open Street Map project and turn it into python dictionary for analysis. After the analysis, turn the dictionary into json file for further analysis with MongoDB.

Given that I am highly skilled in SQL already, I decided to finish the project with MongoDB to master the language.
